  <h2>About</h2>

  <p><strong>Erotico-Inestable</strong> is an artist duo formed by <strong>Sebastián Mejía</strong> and <strong>David Conde</strong>, from Cali, Colombia, active since 2017.</p>

  <p>
    Their work addresses paradoxes embedded in dominant cultural narratives, particularly those concerning the object–subject duality and the current tension between the art world and spectacle: identity, authorship, publicity, authenticity, the autonomy of the individual self, the myth of artistic genius, and the pursuit of freedom and agency within a spectacle-driven, capital-ruled world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their approach is performative and transmedial, and therefore multifaceted. They employ a wide range of media, extending artistic practice into fields such as social media and fashion. Erotico-Inestable refuses to settle into any single format.
  </p>

  <p>
    The duo moves across the triad <strong>I–We–It</strong>, the inseparable correlation between the individual, the social, and the object. Their work spans relational practices and performance, as well as installation, sculpture, video, photography, painting, and digital intervention. They incorporate elements such as fitness machines, light structures, bricks, pallets, and technological devices including televisions, fans, cameras, and mobile phones.
  </p>

  <p>
    The elusive nature of performance as a language of contemporary art—and its unique capacity to foreground acts of framing—opens new ways of addressing questions of identity and, above all, the unresolved question of the nature of art itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>David Conde</strong> and <strong>Sebastián Mejía</strong> use performance both as a medium and as an artistic strategy. <strong>Erotico-Inestable</strong> is more than an artistic project: it is a meta-artist—an artist that presents itself as a work of art, and vice versa, a work of art that presents itself as the artist. The body on stage and its image point toward a subject-object in constant, vital interaction with its environment.
